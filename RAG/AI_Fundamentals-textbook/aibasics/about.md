# Ethics
We are committed to conducting our research in an ethical manner. This includes respecting privacy, ensuring transparency, and considering the societal impacts of our work. AI is a powerful tool created by humans for humans, and it is essential to understand its capabilities and limitations to use it responsibly.

## What even is AI?
Today, the term "artificial intelligence" (AI) is often used as a broad marketing umbrella, capturing a wide array of systems that perform tasks traditionally associated with human cognition. However, it is crucial to recognize that many of these systems—ranging from large language models and autoencoders to advanced versions of perceptrons — do not truly experience or interact with the world as humans do, which calls into question their classification as genuinely intelligent entities. This textbook defines AI in an all-encompassing sense as the scientific and engineering discipline dedicated to developing computational systems capable of perceiving their environment, learning from data, and taking actions aimed at achieving specific goals. While this definition spans the evolution of AI from its foundational concepts in the early 20th century through its modern incarnations up to 2025, it is important to note that a deeper exploration into areas such as [Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_general_intelligence) — which aspires to develop systems with human-like cognitive versatility — is beyond the scope of this course.

## Environmental Costs of AI Technologies

The development and deployment of AI technologies come with significant environmental costs, particularly related to the hardware required to support these systems. The production of AI hardware, such as GPUs and specialized AI chips, involves the extraction of rare earth minerals and other resources, which can lead to habitat destruction, pollution, and significant carbon emissions. Additionally, the energy consumption of data centers that run AI models is substantial, contributing to the overall carbon footprint of AI technologies. As AI continues to grow, it is crucial to consider sustainable practices in the design, production, and operation of AI hardware to mitigate its environmental impact.

The power draw of the latest GPUs is enormous — newer models, such as GPUs with [NVIDIA's Hopper architecture](https://resources.nvidia.com/en-us-tensor-core/nvidia-tensor-core-gpu-datasheet), can consume up to 700 watts of power, equivalent to the energy usage of a small microwave. [In 2023, it was projected](https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/nvidias-h100-gpus-will-consume-more-power-than-some-countries-each-gpu-consumes-700w-of-power-35-million-are-expected-to-be-sold-in-the-coming-year) that the sale of 35 million units in the coming year could result in energy consumption surpassing that of some small countries. This substantial energy demand contributes significantly to the carbon footprint of AI technologies, exacerbating climate change.

The production of AI hardware, such as GPUs and specialized AI chips, also involves the extraction of rare earth minerals and other resources, leading to habitat destruction, pollution, and additional carbon emissions. Moreover, the disposal of outdated or obsolete AI hardware poses another environmental challenge. E-waste, if not properly managed, can release toxic substances into the environment, harming ecosystems and human health.

To mitigate these impacts, it is crucial to adopt sustainable practices in the design, production, and operation of AI hardware. Researchers and developers should prioritize energy-efficient designs, eco-friendly materials, and robust recycling programs. Additionally, users of AI systems can contribute by planning their interactions with AI more carefully. Think like the engineers of the 70s that [used punch cards to run a computer and execute calculations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming_in_the_punched_card_era). Users of AI should consider the environmental cost of every generated image, written story, or chatbot query. By reducing unnecessary computations, we can collectively lower the carbon emissions associated with AI technologies.

## Real-World Examples of AI Decision-Making
Today, AI systems are increasingly making decisions that impact our daily lives. For instance, AI algorithms are currently being used in healthcare to diagnose diseases, recommend treatments, and even predict patient outcomes before any blood is drawn. In finance, AI is employed to detect fraudulent transactions, assess creditworthiness, and manage investment portfolios. Autonomous vehicles rely on AI to navigate and make real-time decisions to ensure passenger safety.

## The Importance of Transparency
Despite its potential, AI should not be treated as a black box that operates without scrutiny. Understanding how AI systems make decisions is crucial to ensure they are fair, unbiased, and aligned with human values. Lack of transparency can lead to mistrust and misuse, with serious consequences for individuals and society.

The dangers associated with keeping AI closed source are significant. When AI systems are proprietary and their workings are not available for public inspection, it becomes easier for biases to go unnoticed and unaddressed. This opacity can result in AI systems making discriminatory decisions based on flawed or biased data, perpetuating inequality and injustice. Furthermore, closed-source AI limits collaboration and innovation, as researchers and developers are unable to build upon existing technologies to improve them.

Moreover, treating AI as a black box gives undue power to those who control it. A single company holding the keys to a powerful AI system can dictate its growth plans, potentially prioritizing profit over ethical considerations. This centralization of power can stifle competition and innovation, leading to a monopolistic hold over technology that influences millions of lives.

By keeping AI open source and transparent, we can promote broader collaboration, ensure accountability, and foster an environment where ethical considerations are integrated into AI development. This approach not only mitigates risks associated with bias and discrimination but also encourages a more inclusive and equitable technological future.

## The Importance of Open Source
Open source is often considered superior to proprietary software because it promotes transparency, collaboration, and innovation by default. With open-source software, all source code is publicly accessible - allowing anyone to inspect, learn, modify, and improve it. This transparency ensures that software can be audited for security vulnerabilities, reducing the risk of hidden flaws or malicious backdoors. Furthermore, open source encourages collective innovation, as developers worldwide can contribute to and enhance the software, resulting in more robust and efficient solutions. In contrast, proprietary software is controlled by a single capitalistic entity, limiting user freedom and innovation while often locking users into specific ecosystems.

The benefits of open source extend beyond traditional software into the realm of artificial intelligence development. Open-source AI models and frameworks foster a collaborative environment where researchers and developers can share breakthroughs, improving the speed and quality of advancements. This openness ensures that cutting-edge technology is accessible to a broader community, reducing the concentration of AI power in the hands of a few corporations. It also allows for greater ethical oversight, as public access to AI algorithms promotes accountability and fairness. Without open access, proprietary AI systems risk being "black boxes" with unchecked biases and opaque decision-making processes. We hope this textbook not only advances but also broadens the horizons of open-source artificial intelligence!

## Demystifying AI
We believe it’s crucial to demystify so-called "AI" systems and challenge the misconception that they possess anything resembling true intelligence. Throughout the textbook, we emphasize that AI models are not intelligent agents but pattern-matching tools that operate based solely on statistical regularities in their training data. In our chapter on Transformers, for example, we use data related to Picasso to demonstrate that an LLM doesn’t "understand" anything — it's output mimics paterns in its training data based on exposure. These ideas are actively explored in our “[Art & Generative AI](https://github.com/Fedele-AI/Art_and_AI)” class at Georgia Tech, where we encourage students to see AI not as a creative genius, but as a flawed collaborator — one whose failures, biases, and limitations offer insight into human-machine interaction. Our goal is to strip away the hype and instead foster real understanding of how these tools work, what they can and cannot do, and how they might be used ethically, critically, and creatively.

Many respected voices in the computing and ethics communities, such as [Dr. Richard Stallman](https://stallman.org/chatgpt.html), strongly oppose the use of the term “AI” to describe systems like large language models. Stallman argues that these models are not intelligent by any meaningful definition, as they lack understanding, awareness, or knowledge of what their outputs mean. He refers to systems like ChatGPT as “bullshit generators,” emphasizing that they produce fluent-sounding responses with complete indifference to truth. This widespread mislabeling leads to a dangerous overestimation of their capabilities and encourages misplaced trust. We share this concern and actively work to counteract the myth of artificial “intelligence” by showing students and readers how these models really work: not as thinking entities, but as statistical parrots trained on vast datasets. In doing so, we hope to promote transparency, skepticism, and a healthier relationship between people and the tools they use.

### Further Ethical Considerations
Our commitment to ethical AI research involves:
- **Respecting Privacy:** Ensuring that personal data is handled with care and used responsibly.
- **Ensuring Transparency:** Making AI decision-making processes understandable and accessible.
- **Considering Societal Impacts:** Evaluating the broader implications of AI technologies on society and striving to mitigate any negative effects.
