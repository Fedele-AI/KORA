## Introduction
The term “Artificial Intelligence” is everywhere — but it’s often misunderstood. Despite the name, these systems don’t actually possess intelligence or understanding. What’s typically called “AI” today refers to models that generate outputs based on patterns in data. They don’t comprehend meaning, context, or truth; they operate by predicting what comes next in a sequence, based on what they've seen before.

**This textbook is open to everyone** — _no background in machine learning is required_. If you’re comfortable with basic Python and introductory calculus, you’ll be able to follow along and engage with every concept. Whether you're encountering AI for the first time or revisiting it with a more critical perspective, our goal is to make the inner workings of these systems clear, approachable, and honest. We focus on what these tools actually do — and just as importantly, what they can’t.

You’ll explore core models and techniques, from basic neural networks to complex architectures like transformers, paired with hands-on coding exercises. Along the way, we emphasize the limitations, risks, and philosophical questions that come with generative models. By the end, you’ll not only have the skills to build these systems — you’ll also have the language to talk about them honestly!

## About
This educational series has been meticulously crafted to serve a diverse audience of learners, from those taking their very first steps into artificial intelligence to those with prior exposure seeking to deepen their understanding. The curriculum follows a carefully designed progression that builds foundational knowledge while gradually introducing more complex concepts. This textbook was created for, [and was used in](https://ce.gatech.edu/news/2025/05/new-course-broadens-students-horizons-using-ai), Georgia Tech’s [CEE 4803 - Art & Generative AI](https://github.com/Fedele-AI/Art_and_AI) course.

For beginners, we've taken special care to explain concepts clearly with intuitive examples and visualizations that make abstract ideas concrete. Meanwhile, more experienced learners will find sufficient depth and advanced material to expand their knowledge boundaries. If you already possess familiarity with certain fundamental topics, you're encouraged to navigate directly to modules that challenge your current expertise level.

This series represents our commitment to making high-quality AI education accessible to everyone, regardless of background or prior technical experience. 'AI' as we know it today, exists as a marketing term - we aim to democratize access to AI knowledge, foster critical thinking about AI's capabilities and limitations, and empower a new generation of innovators to apply these tools ethically and creatively. The interdisciplinary approach integrates perspectives from computer science, mathematics, engineering, and cognitive science to provide a comprehensive understanding of how artificial intelligence systems work and evolve.
We sincerely hope this learning journey proves valuable as you explore the fascinating world of artificial intelligence, whether your goals involve academic advancement, professional development, or personal enrichment! Your feedback is welcomed as we continuously strive to improve and expand these educational resources.
